Safety Algorithm

1) Let Work and Finish be vectors of length ‘m’ and ‘n’ respectively.
Initialize: Work = Available
Finish[i] = false; for i=1, 2, 3, 4….n

2) Find an i such that both
a) Finish[i] = false
b) Needi <= Work
if no such i exists goto step (4)

3) Work = Work + Allocation[i]
Finish[i] = true
goto step (2)

4) if Finish [i] = true for all i
then the system is in a safe state

Resource-Request Algorithm

1) If Requesti <= Needi
Goto step (2) ; otherwise, raise an error condition, since the process has exceeded its maximum claim.

2) If Requesti <= Available
Goto step (3); otherwise, Pi must wait, since the resources are not available.

3) Have the system pretend to have allocated the requested resources to process Pi by modifying the state as
follows:
Available = Available – Requesti
Allocationi = Allocationi + Requesti
Needi = Needi– Requesti
