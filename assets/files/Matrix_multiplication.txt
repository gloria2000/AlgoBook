Step 1: Start the Program.

Step 2: Enter the row and column of the first (a) matrix.

Step 3: Enter the row and column of the second (b) matrix.

Step 4: Enter the elements of the first (a) matrix.

Step 5: Enter the elements of the second (b) matrix.

Step 6: Print the elements of the first (a) matrix in matrix form.

Step 7: Print the elements of the second (b) matrix in matrix form.

Step 8: Set a loop up to row.

Step 9: Set an inner loop up to the column.

Step 10: Set another inner loop up to the column.

Step 11: Multiply the first (a) and second (b) matrix and store the element in the third matrix (c)

Step 12: Print the final matrix.

Step 13: Stop the Program.
